Hi, I’m Cyrill Marti and I’m interested in, well... coding obviously. And space. I think that these two things are really cool. Hope you do too.

Currently learning many new skills for school like mySQL databases and website development.

Also member of the team 6417 Fridolins Robotiks competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition (in the CAD team though).
