Hi, I’m Cyrill Marti and I’m interested in, well... coding obviously. And space. I think that these two things are really cool. Hope you do too.

Currently, I'm working on creating a database for a school project that aims to replicate the functionality of a database currently used by the association of traffic wardens. It'll probably never be used but... will probably yield a good grade.

Also member of the team 6417 Fridolins Robotiks competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition (in the CAD team though).
